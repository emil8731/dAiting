# Dating App AI Assistant - Component Interaction

## Overview
This document describes the interactions between components in the Dating App AI Assistant, focusing on the flow of data and control between different modules.

## Key Component Interactions

### 1. User Authentication Flow
```
User Interface → Authentication Service → Platform Integration Layer → Dating Platform API
```
- User provides credentials through the UI
- Authentication Service validates and secures credentials
- Platform Integration Layer uses credentials to authenticate with dating platforms
- Authentication tokens are returned and securely stored

### 2. Profile Scraping Flow
```
Platform Integration Layer → Dating Platform API → Data Processing Service → Profile Database
```
- Platform Integration modules connect to respective dating platforms
- Profile data is retrieved from platform APIs
- Data Processing Service normalizes and enriches the data
- Processed profiles are stored in the Profile Database

### 3. Message Generation Flow
```
Profile Database → Profile Analysis Engine → Message Template System → OpenAI Integration → User Interface
```
- Profile data is retrieved from the database
- Profile Analysis Engine identifies conversation hooks and topics
- Message Template System selects appropriate templates
- OpenAI Integration generates personalized message content
- Generated messages are presented to user for approval via UI

### 4. Message Sending Flow
```
User Interface → Message Sender → Platform Integration Layer → Dating Platform API
```
- User approves message through the UI
- Message Sender prepares the message for delivery
- Platform Integration Layer formats message for the specific platform
- Message is sent to the dating platform API

### 5. Conversation Monitoring Flow
```
Platform Integration Layer → Message Retriever → Conversation Database → Notification System → User Interface
```
- Platform Integration Layer periodically checks for new messages
- Message Retriever processes and formats incoming messages
- Messages are stored in the Conversation Database
- Notification System alerts user to new messages
- User Interface displays conversation updates

### 6. Response Generation Flow
```
Conversation Database → Conversation Flow Manager → Response Generator → User Interface
```
- Conversation history is retrieved from the database
- Conversation Flow Manager determines appropriate response type
- Response Generator creates contextually relevant responses
- Generated responses are presented to user for approval via UI

## Cross-Component Services

### Data Synchronization Service
Ensures consistency between local data and platform data:
```
Platform Integration Layer ↔ Data Management Layer
```

### User Preference Service
Applies user preferences across all components:
```
Settings Manager → All Components
```

### Security Service
Manages encryption, token refresh, and secure storage:
```
Authentication Component ↔ All Components
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Authentication Failure Recovery
```
Platform Integration Layer → Authentication Component → User Interface
```
- Detects authentication failures
- Attempts token refresh
- Prompts user for re-authentication if needed

### API Change Detection
```
Platform Integration Layer → Error Handling Service → Notification System
```
- Monitors for API changes or failures
- Logs detailed error information
- Notifies user of service disruptions

## Asynchronous Processing

The system uses asynchronous processing for:
- Periodic checking for new matches and messages
- Background profile analysis
- Message generation and template selection
- Data synchronization between local storage and platforms

## Component Extensibility

The modular design allows for:
- Adding new dating platform integrations
- Extending message generation capabilities
- Enhancing profile analysis algorithms
- Implementing additional notification channels
