# Dating App AI Assistant - System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and data flow for the Dating App AI Assistant, which connects to dating platforms (Tinder and Hinge), scrapes match information, generates personalized messages, and manages conversations.

## System Components

### 1. Platform Integration Layer
This layer handles authentication and communication with dating platforms.

#### Tinder Integration Module
- **Authentication Component**: Manages X-Auth-Token acquisition and storage
- **Profile Scraper**: Extracts match profile data from Tinder API
- **Message Retriever**: Gets conversation history and new messages
- **Message Sender**: Sends messages to matches

#### Hinge Integration Module
- **Authentication Component**: Handles complex authentication flow with Google Identity Platform
- **Profile Scraper**: Extracts match profile data from Hinge API
- **Message Retriever**: Interfaces with SendBird to get conversation history
- **Message Sender**: Sends messages through SendBird API

### 2. Data Management Layer
This layer handles storage and processing of extracted data.

#### Profile Database
- Stores match profile information
- Indexes data for quick retrieval
- Manages data lifecycle and privacy controls

#### Conversation Database
- Stores message history
- Tracks conversation state and context
- Maintains relationship between profiles and conversations

#### Data Processing Service
- Cleans and normalizes profile data
- Extracts key information from profiles (interests, topics, etc.)
- Prepares data for message generation

### 3. AI Message Generation Layer
This layer handles the creation of personalized messages.

#### Profile Analysis Engine
- Identifies conversation hooks from profile data
- Detects interests, hobbies, and potential talking points
- Scores topics by relevance and engagement potential

#### Message Template System
- Maintains library of message templates
- Categorizes templates by context and purpose
- Supports variable substitution for personalization

#### OpenAI Integration
- Connects to OpenAI API for message generation
- Provides context from profile and conversation history
- Ensures message quality and relevance

### 4. Conversation Management Layer
This layer handles ongoing conversations.

#### Conversation Flow Manager
- Tracks conversation state and context
- Identifies appropriate response types
- Manages conversation timing and pacing

#### Response Generator
- Creates contextually appropriate responses
- Maintains conversation coherence
- Adapts tone and style to match preferences

#### Notification System
- Alerts user to new matches and messages
- Provides conversation summaries
- Highlights important interactions

### 5. User Interface Layer
This layer handles user interaction with the system.

#### Web Interface
- Dashboard for monitoring matches and conversations
- Configuration controls for system behavior
- Message review and approval interface

#### Settings Manager
- Controls for messaging style and frequency
- Platform connection management
- Privacy and data retention settings

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User provides credentials for dating platforms
   - System authenticates with platforms
   - Authentication tokens are securely stored

2. **Profile Extraction Flow**:
   - System retrieves match profiles from platforms
   - Profile data is processed and normalized
   - Processed profiles are stored in database

3. **Message Generation Flow**:
   - System analyzes profile for conversation hooks
   - AI generates personalized initial message
   - User reviews and approves message
   - Approved message is sent to match

4. **Conversation Management Flow**:
   - System monitors for new messages
   - New messages trigger response generation
   - User reviews and approves responses
   - Conversation history is updated

5. **Notification Flow**:
   - System detects important events (new matches, messages)
   - Notifications are generated and sent to user
   - User can take action based on notifications

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- **Authentication Security**:
  - Tokens and credentials encrypted at rest
  - Secure authentication flow
  - Regular token refresh

- **Data Protection**:
  - Encrypted storage for all user and match data
  - Data minimization principles applied
  - User control over data retention

- **Ethical Messaging**:
  - Transparency about AI assistance
  - User approval required for all messages
  - No deceptive communication practices

## Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: Python with Flask for API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for message generation
- **Web Interface**: Flask templates with Bootstrap for responsive design
- **Authentication**: OAuth for user authentication, secure token storage for platforms

## Scalability Considerations

- Modular design allows for adding additional dating platforms
- Separation of concerns enables independent scaling of components
- Asynchronous processing for handling multiple conversations
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
